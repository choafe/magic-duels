# Welcome to Magic Duels!

## Organization of the Github
1. Add new project folder per major PCB and PCB prototypes.
2. Create a new branch for each project.
3. Work on the project fully on each separate branch until major completion, which should require pull-request into the main branch.
4. Shared libraries should be created independently in another folder, and will by default, automatically be merged into main library.
